**Rectangle Application**

This application manages a main rectangle and an array of secondary rectangles, offering various features such as color filtering, coordinate handling, and customizable logging options.

**Functionality**

*Main Rectangle:*

Defines extreme points based on the array of secondary rectangles.
Properties include color, bottom-left (BotLeft) and top-right (TopRight) points.

*Secondary Rectangles:*

Properties include color, bottom-left (BotLeft), and top-right (TopRight) points.

**Additional Features:**

*Coordinate Handling:*
Ability to ignore secondary rectangles initially outside the main rectangle's boundaries.

*Color Filtering:*
Option to select or ignore rectangles based on specified colors.

*Logging Options:*
Choose between logging to the console or a text file for application operations.


**Example Usage**

*Select File:*
Load a JSON file containing rectangle data to initialize the main and secondary rectangles.

*Calculate:*
Update the main rectangle based on selected options (ignore out-of-bounds, color filters).

*Zoom and Visualize:*
Zoom in or out to adjust the visualization of rectangles on the canvas.


**Testing and Validation**

*Visual Verification:*
The correctness of application operations has been visually confirmed through interactive usage and observation of results on the canvas.
This includes verifying the correct handling of boundary conditions, color filtering, and overall application behavior.
